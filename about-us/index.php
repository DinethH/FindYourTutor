		ABOUT US
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Modernization has led us to get everything be controlled by computers but there are still some things that are not viable through these computers. Among those things is personal intimacy between teacher and student. 
		With this consideration in mind, we came with the idea of a connection between such tutors and students, and brought this website to you. "Find A Tutor". 
		"Find A Tutor" starves to find students the perfect tutor match and also gives a platform for talented tutors to help students in need.
